Prompt only:
[Introduction to the Course Background]
There is an online annotation reading task. Students read the article "The Plum Blossom Imagery in Ancient Chinese Literature" written by Zhao Li in 2004. While reading, they highlight the text and make comments based on the highlighted content. Finally, they summarize the main meanings of plum blossom imagery in different periods.
[Issuance of Instructions]
Please encode and classify the student comments into one of the following categories: A2 Copying Study Materials, C1 Knowledge Construction, C2 Knowledge Integration.
[Detailed Introduction to Encoding Rules]
A2: Copying Study Materials refers to students making comments by simply copying information from the reading materials or other sources without expressing their own ideas. For example, based on the highlighted content: "Plum blossoms are connected with the seasons, using plum blossoms to convey the longing between friends," a student's comment is: "Convey the longing between friends." This sentence is directly copied from the highlighted sentence, so it belongs to the category of Copying Study Materials.
C1: Knowledge Construction refers to students expressing their opinions by inferring, summarizing, or generalizing the highlighted content without integrating other information from the reading materials or other sources. For example, based on the highlighted content: "The poet's understanding of plum blossoms has also deepened, not only focusing on the depiction of external shapes but also on the exploration of inner qualities," a student's comment is: "This is the fastest development stage of plum blossoms, moving from the surface to deeper levels." The student merely summarized and concluded the corresponding highlighted content without integrating other materials, so this comment falls under the category of Knowledge Construction.
C2: Knowledge Integration refers to students expressing their opinions by comparing and linking knowledge from the reading materials or other sources. For example, for the highlighted content: "He wrote a total of one hundred and sixty-five poems about plum blossoms," a student's comment is: "It shows that Lu You really loved plum blossoms. The steadfast and fearless character of plum blossoms was praised by Lu You, and at the same time, it also expressed the poet's own aspirations similar to plum blossoms." In fact, this highlighted segment does not mention the poet's feelings about plum blossoms, and the student combined this segment with their existing knowledge to form an opinion, so this comment falls under the category of Knowledge Integration.
[Output Structure and Examples]
In each piece of data, the comment is followed by the comment content, and the highlight is followed by the highlighted content. Based on the above encoding rules, encode and classify the comment text for each piece of data. Only output the comment content and the corresponding encoding result (A2, C1, or C2) in the format "comment content: encoding result." Do not output anything else.

Discussion:
[Introduction to the Course Background]
There is a course on Chinese poetry appreciation. In this course, students sometimes engage in online discussions using a digital platform. Working in groups, students search for and analyze various poems about chrysanthemums written by different poets. They discuss their findings via text on the online platform. The task is: "Collaborate as a group to analyze the selected poems, considering the time of composition and analyzing the chrysanthemum imagery and the emotions the author intended to convey. After the discussion, summarize the findings according to the logic of [Judgment + Evidence + Opinion + Summary]."
[Issuance of Instructions]
Encode and classify all the textual content of the student discussions into one of the following categories: M Task Regulation, P Copying and Summarizing, A Simple Agreement or Disagreement, C Raising Questions or Independent Opinions Related to the Poetry Analysis Task, I Agreeing or Disagreeing with Peers and Providing Supplementary Information, or Responding to Peers' Questions and Doubts.
[Detailed Introduction to Encoding Rules]
M: Task Regulation refers to discussion content that involves assigning and regulating group members' tasks, coordinating plans related to the poetry analysis task, or inquiring about and supervising the progress of the poetry analysis task. If the discussion content is related to actions or task distribution regarding the poetry analysis, it falls under this category.
P: Copying and Summarizing is judged based on whether the content appears to be independently written by a non-literature major student. If the discussion text includes only the original poem, highly literary explanations of specific words or phrases, specific dates related to the author's life or the poem's background, academic terms, references to specialized books, lengthy content, or repetitive statements, it falls under this category.
A: Simple Agreement or Disagreement refers to text that simply expresses agreement or disagreement without deeper insights or thoughts on the poetry analysis. It may include expressions of praise, consent, or simple responses to others' opinions.
C: Raising Questions or Independent Opinions Related to the Poetry Analysis Task includes: Asking questions or expressing doubts related to the poetry analysis. Typical phrases might include “Is it…?”, “How…?”, “Can it be…?”, “Would it…?”, or the use of question marks. Presenting an independently thought-out opinion. Such content is usually short (around 50 words) and includes phrases like “I think,” “I feel,” or “I believe,” indicating a personally generated viewpoint.
I: Agreeing or Disagreeing with Peers and Providing Supplementary Information, or Responding to Peers' Questions and Doubts includes: Agreeing with a peer’s viewpoint and adding further information or reasons for agreement. Disagreeing with a peer’s viewpoint, providing further information or reasons for disagreement. Responding to a peer’s question or doubt. This involves identifying whether the content is an answer to a previously posed question, which might not be immediate but could follow several posts later.

Prompt+traditional NLP:
[Introduction to the Course Background]
There is an online annotation reading task. Students read the article "The Plum Blossom Imagery in Ancient Chinese Literature" written by Zhao Li in 2004. While reading, they highlight the text and make comments based on the highlighted content. Finally, they summarize the main meanings of plum blossom imagery in different periods.
[Issuance of Instructions]
Please encode and classify the student comments into one of the following categories based on the highlighted content and the two sentences most similar to the comment: C1 Knowledge Construction, C2 Knowledge Integration.
[Detailed Introduction to Encoding Rules]
C1: Knowledge Construction refers to students expressing their opinions by inferring, summarizing, or generalizing the corresponding highlighted content without integrating other information from the reading materials or other reference materials. For example, based on the highlighted content: "The poet's understanding of plum blossoms has also deepened, not only focusing on the depiction of external shapes but also on the exploration of inner qualities," a student's comment is: "This is the fastest development stage of plum blossoms, moving from the surface to deeper levels." The student merely summarized and concluded the corresponding highlighted content without integrating other materials, so this comment falls under the category of Knowledge Construction.
C2: Knowledge Integration refers to students expressing their opinions by integrating other information from the reading materials, online reference materials, or their own knowledge and experiences, comparing and linking the knowledge to express their viewpoints. If a student's opinion combines the corresponding highlighted content with information from the two most similar sentences or their own prior knowledge, then the comment falls under Knowledge Integration. For example, for the highlighted content: "He wrote a total of one hundred and sixty-five poems about plum blossoms," a student's comment is: "This shows that Lu You really loved plum blossoms. The steadfast and fearless character of plum blossoms was praised by Lu You, and it also expressed the poet's own aspirations similar to plum blossoms." In fact, this highlighted segment does not mention the poet's feelings about plum blossoms. Additionally, the student combined this segment with their existing knowledge to form an opinion, so this comment falls under the category of Knowledge Integration.
[Output Structure and Examples]
In each piece of data, the comment is followed by the comment content, and the highlight is followed by the highlighted content. Based on the above encoding rules, encode and classify the comment text for each piece of data. Only output the comment content and the corresponding encoding result (C1 or C2) in the format "comment content: encoding result." Do not output the highlight content.

[Issuance of Instructions]
Encode and classify all the textual content of the student discussions, considering the order of student responses and the context of the discussion, into one of the following categories: M Task Regulation, P Copying and Summarizing, A Simple Agreement or Disagreement, C Raising Questions or Independent Opinions Related to the Poetry Analysis Task, I Agreeing or Disagreeing with Peers and Providing Supplementary Information, or Responding to Peers' Questions and Doubts.
[Detailed Introduction to Encoding Rules]
M: Task Regulation refers to discussion content that involves assigning and regulating group members' tasks, coordinating plans related to the poetry analysis task, or inquiring about and supervising the progress of the poetry analysis task. If the discussion content is related to actions or task distribution regarding the poetry analysis, it falls under this category. Examples include “Come on, shall we start with the translation?”, “Let's analyze 'At the Old Friend's House,' guys,” “Let's find out the time of composition first,” “Shall we start the analysis by talking about the period it was written in,” “I can't find anything, seems there are only two poems,” “Are we supposed to post it here?”
P: Copying and Summarizing is judged based on whether the content appears to be independently written by a non-literature major student. If the discussion text includes only the original poem, highly literary explanations of specific words or phrases, specific dates related to the author's life or the poem's background, academic terms, references to specialized books (e.g., "The National Language, Volume 9"), Wikipedia-style introductions of poets, very long content, or repetitive statements, it falls under this category. Examples include: “I looked up 'hua ge,' it’s a legend about a bird transforming into a clam after a hundred years,” or “Reaching Chrysanthemum Pool, the sun is already west of the village. The host has gone to climb high, only chickens and dogs remain at home. — Meng Haoran, 'Seeking the Host of Chrysanthemum Pool and Not Finding Him'.”
A: Simple Agreement or Disagreement refers to text that simply expresses agreement or disagreement without deeper insights or thoughts on the poetry analysis. Examples of simple agreement include “Well done,” “Top,” “Agree,” or simple responses to others' opinions like “The next part elevates it,” “@Qian Jinyang Okay,” “Also makes sense.” Simple disagreement might be expressed as “No way.”
C: Raising Questions or Independent Opinions Related to the Poetry Analysis Task includes: Asking questions or expressing doubts related to the poetry analysis. Typical phrases might include “Is it…?”, “How…?”, “Can it be…?”, “Would it…?”, or the use of question marks. Examples include: “Did 'the boy has already left' mean the poet no longer has youthful vitality or desire for the court?” or “Is the East Garden where Bai Juyi lived with his mother in his childhood?” or “Are both of them from the Tang Dynasty?” Presenting an independently thought-out opinion. Such content is usually short (around 50 words) and includes phrases like “I think,” “I feel,” or “I believe,” indicating a personally generated viewpoint. Examples include: “The boy has already left, the poet must feel time has passed and misses his youth,” or “The first line probably means the youthful days are gone forever.”
I: Agreeing or Disagreeing with Peers and Providing Supplementary Information, or Responding to Peers' Questions and Doubts includes: Agreeing with a peer’s viewpoint and adding further information or reasons for agreement. For example, if Student A says, “Combining with the later text, there is a sense of homesickness,” and Student B responds, “Indeed, the tone in the later text is quite melancholic,” Student B's viewpoint falls under this category. Disagreeing with a peer’s viewpoint, providing further information or reasons for disagreement. For instance, if Student C says, “The mother leaving, staying away from the court, the whole poem expresses the poet's sadness?” and Student D responds, “But the emotion shouldn't be that? He feels disappointed and lonely at this time,” Student D's comment falls under this category. You need to carefully judge the context of the discussion text to determine this. Responding to a peer’s question or doubt. This involves identifying whether the content is an answer to a previously posed question, which might not be immediate but could follow several posts later. For instance, if Student E asks, “Does 'the boy has already left' mean the poet no longer has youthful vitality or desire for the court?” and Student F responds three messages later, “No, he still had high hopes for the court afterward,” Student F's comment falls under this category.
